Build a Product Landing Page
Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks. Do not copy this demo project.

User Stories:

+Your product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header"

+You can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img" (A logo would make a good image here)

+Within the #header element, you can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar"

+You can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link

+ When you click a .nav-link button in the nav element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page ===>>> action="" is the answer

+ You can watch an embedded product video with id="video"

+ Your landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form"

+ Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where you can enter an email address

+ The #email input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for

+ The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address

+ Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit"

 When you click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit)

The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport

Your product landing page should have at least one media query

Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once

Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding!

Note: Be sure to add <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> in your HTML to link your stylesheet and apply your CSS
