Move the display, flex-direction, and align-items properties and values from .bb1 to the new building-wrap class. */

Give the sky class a radial-gradient. Use #ffcf33 from 0% to 20%, #ffff66 at 21%, and #bbeeff at 100%. This will add circular gradient to the background that will be your sun. */

/* Step 113
At the top of the sky gradient color list, where you would put a direction for the gradient; add circle closest-corner at 15% 15%,. This will move the start of the gradient to 15% from the top and left. It will make it end at the closest-corner and it will maintain a circle shape.

/* Step 50
Create a new variable in :root named window-color2 with a value of #8cd9b3. This will be used as the secondary color for this building. */

Gradient transitions often gradually change from one color to another. You can make the change a solid line like this:

linear-gradient(
  var(--first-color) 0%,
  var(--first-color) 40%,
  var(--second-color) 40%,
  var(--second-color) 80%
);
Add a linear-gradient to .bb2b that uses --building-color2 from 0% to 6% and --window-color2 from 6% to 9%. */

/* Step 52
You can see the hard color change at the top of the section. Change the gradient type from linear-gradient to repeating-linear-gradient for this section. This will make the four colors of your gradient repeat until it gets to the bottom of the element; giving you some stripes, and saving you from having to add a bunch of elements to create them. */

/* Step 53
In the next few steps, you are going to use some tricks with CSS borders to turn the .bb2a section into a triangle at the top of the building. First, remove the background-color from .bb2 since you don't need it anymore. */

/* Step 54
Create and add the following properties to .bb2a:

margin: auto;
width: 5vw;
height: 5vw;
border-top: 1vw solid #000;
border-bottom: 1vw solid #000;
border-left: 1vw solid #999;
border-right: 1vw solid #999;
After you add these, you can see how a thick border on an element gives you some angles where two sides meet. You are going to use that bottom border as the top of the building. */

/* Step 55
Next, remove the width and height from .bb2a, and change the border-left and border-right to use 5vw instead of 1vw. The element will now have zero size and the borders will come together in the middle. */

/* Step 56
Next, change the two #999 of .bb2a to transparent. This will make the left and right borders invisible. */

/* Step 57
Remove the margin and border-top properties and values from .bb2a to turn it into a triangle for the top of the building. */

/* Step 58
Finally, on the border-bottom property of .bb2a, change the 1vw to 5vh and change the #000 color to your --building-color2 variable. There you go, now it looks good! At any time throughout this project, you can comment out or remove the border property you added to everything at the beginning to see what the buildings will look like when that gets removed at the end. */

/* Step 59
On to the next building! Create a new variable called --window-color3 in :root and give it a value of #d98cb3. This will be the secondary color for the pink buildings. */

/* Step 60
So far, all the gradients you created have gone from top to bottom, that's the default direction. You can specify another direction by adding it before your colors like this:

gradient-type(
  direction,
  color1,
  color2
);
Fill in .bb3 with a repeating-linear-gradient. Use 90deg for the direction, your building-color3 for the first two colors, and window-color3 at 15% for the third. When you don't specify a distance for a color, it will use the values that makes sense. In this case, the first two colors will default to 0% and 7.5% because it starts at 0%, and 7.5% is half of the 15%. */

/* Step 61Passed
Remove the background-color property and value from .bb3 since you are using the gradient as the background now. */

.bb3 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 55%;
  /* background-color: var(--building-color3); */
  background: repeating-linear-gradient(
    90deg,
    var(--building-color3),
    var(--building-color3),
    var(--window-color3) 15%
  );
}

/* Step 62
The next building will have three sections. Nest three div elements within .bb4. Give them the classes of bb4a, bb4b and bb4c in that order. */

.bb4 {
  width: 11%;
  height: 58%;
  /* background-color: var(--building-color4) */
}

/* Step 63
Give the new div elements these width and height values: 3% and 10% to .bb4a, 80% and 5% to .bb4b, and 100% and 85% to .bb4c. */

.bb4a {
  width: 3%;
  height: 10%;
  background-color: var(--building-color4);
}

.bb4b {
  width: 80%;
  height: 5%;

  background-color: var(--building-color4);
}

.bb4c {
  width: 100%;
  height: 85%;
  background-color: var(--building-color4);
}

/* Step 64
Remove the background-color property and value from .bb4, and add it to the three new sections .bb4a, .bb4b, and .bb4c, so only the sections are filled. */

/* Step 65
You want .bb4 to share the properties of .bb1 that center the sections. Instead of duplicating that code, create a new class above the background building comment called building-wrap. Leave it empty for now; this class will be used in a few places to save you some coding. */

/* Step 69
Nest four new div elements within .bb4c, give them all the class of bb4-window. These will be windows for this building. */

/* Step 70
Give the bb4-window class a width of 18%, a height of 90%, and add your --window-color4 variable as the background-color. */

.bb4-window {
  width: 18%;
  height: 90%;
  background-color: var(--window-color4);
}

/* Step 29
You want the .foreground-buildings container to sit directly on top of the .background-buildings element. Give it a width and height of 100%, set the position to absolute, and the top to 0. This will make it the same size as the body and move the start of it to the top left corner. */

/* Step 32
Add the same display, align-items, and justify-content properties and values to .foreground-buildings that you used on .background-buildings. Again, this will use Flexbox to evenly space the buildings across the bottom of their container. */
/* burayı sonra kodu iyileştirmek için, background-buildings class'ıyla birlikte yazmak üzere taşıdık. */
/* .foreground-buildings {
    width: 100%;

    justify-content: space-evenly;
} */

/* Step 35
The skyline is coming together. Fill in the background-color property of the foreground buildings. Use your --building-color1 variable to fill in .fb3 and .fb4, --building-color2 for .fb5, --building-color3 for .fb2 and .fb6, and --building-color4 for .fb1. */

/* FOREGROUND BUILDINGS - "fb" stands for "foreground building" */

/* Step 73
Looks good! On to the foreground buildings! Turn the .fb1 building into three sections by nesting three new div elements within it. Give them the classes of fb1a, fb1b and fb1c, in that order. */

/* Step 74
Give .fb1b a width of 60% and height of 10%, and .fb1c a width of 100% and height of 80%. */

/* Step 75
Add the building-wrap class to the .fb1 element to center the sections. */

/* Step 76
Move the background-color property and value from .fb1 to .fb1b. */

/* Step 77
Don't worry about the space at the bottom, everything will get moved down later when you add some height to the element at the top of the building.

Add a repeating-linear-gradient to .fb1c with a 90deg angle, your --building-color4 from 0% to 10% and transparent from 10% to 15%. */

/* Step 78
You can add multiple gradients to an element by separating them with a comma (,) like this:

gradient1(
  colors
),
gradient2(
  colors
);
Add a repeating-linear-gradient to .fb1c below the one that's there; use your --building-color4 from 0% to 10% and --window-color4 from 10% and 90%. This will fill in behind the gradient you added last. */

/* Step 79
You're going to use some more border tricks for the top section. Add a border-bottom with a value of 7vh solid var(--building-color4) to .fb1a. This will put a 7vh height border on the bottom. But since the element has zero size, it only shows up as a 2px wide line from the 1px border that is on all the elements. */

/* Step 80
When you increase the size of the left and right borders, the border on the bottom will expand to be the width of the combined left and right border widths. Add 2vw solid transparent as the value of the border-left and border-right properties of .fb1a. They will be invisible, but it will make the border on the bottom 4vw wide. */

.fb1 {
  width: 10%;
  height: 60%;

On to the next building! Nest two div elements within .fb2 and give them classes of fb2a and fb2b, in that order. */

/* Step 82
Give .fb2a a width of 100% and .fb2b a width of 100% and height of 75%. */

/* Step 83
Nest three div elements within .fb2b and give them a class of fb2-window. These will be windows for this section of the building. */

/* Step 84
Add your window-wrap class to .fb2b to position the new window elements. */

/* Step 85
Give the .fb2-window elements a width of 22%, height of 100%, and a background-color of your --window-color3 variable. */

/* Step 86
Move the background-color property and value from .fb2 to .fb2b to just color the section and not the container. */

/* Step 87
For .fb2a, add a border-bottom of 10vh solid var(--building-color3), and a border-left and border-right of 1vw solid transparent. This time the border trick will create a trapezoid shape. */

/* Step 89
Give the .fb3a element a width of 80% and height of 15%. Then give the .fb3b element a width of 100% and height of 35%. */

/* Step 90
Remove the background-color property and value from .fb3, and add them to .fb3a and .fb3b. */

Add your building-wrap class to the .fb3 element to center the sections. */

/* Step 92
Nest three new div elements in the first .fb3a element. Give them each a class of fb3-window. These will be windows for this section. */

/* Step 93

The windows are stacked on top of each other on the rightmost purple building. Turn the building into a flexbox parent, and use the flex-wrap property to put the windows side by side, and push them down to a new row when they don't fit. */

/* Step 103

On to the next building! It's the green one in the foreground. Give it a repeating-linear-gradient with your building color from 0% to 5%, and transparent from 5% to 10%. */

/* Step 105
Add another repeating-linear-gradient below the one you just added. Give it a 90deg direction, use your building color from 0% to 12% and window color 12% to 44%. This will make a bunch of rectangle windows. */

/* Step 108
Add another repeating gradient to this building; make it the same as the one you just added, except don't add the 90deg direction and use your window color instead of the two transparent colors. */

/* Step 109
You can remove the background-color for this building now, since it isn't needed. */

.fb6 {
  width: 9%;
  height: 38%;
  /* background-color: var(--building-color3); */
  background: repeating-linear-gradient(
      90deg,
      var(--building-color3),
      var(--building-color3) 10%,
      transparent 10%,
      transparent 30%

      var(--window-color3) 10%,
      var(--window-color3) 30%
    );
}

/* Step 36
Squeeze the buildings together again by adding two empty div elements within both the top and bottom of the .foreground-buildings element, and one more in between .fb2 and .fb3. */

/* Step 37
Move the position of .fb4 relative to where it is now by adding a position of relative and left of 10% to it. Do the same for .fb5 but use right instead of left. This will cover up the remaining white space in between the buildings. */

/* Step 38
Your code is starting to get quite long. Add a comment above the .fb1 class that says FOREGROUND BUILDINGS - "fb" stands for "foreground building" to help people understand your code. Above the .bb1 class add another comment that says BACKGROUND BUILDINGS - "bb" stands for "background building". If you don't remember, comments in CSS look like this: '/* Comment here *'/. */

/* Step 39
Create a new variable in :root called --window-color1 and give it a value of black. This will be a secondary color for the purple buildings. */

/* Step 40
Gradients in CSS are a way to transition between colors across the distance of an element. They are applied to the background property and the syntax looks like this:

gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2
);
In the example, color1 is solid at the top, color2 is solid at the bottom, and in between it transitions evenly from one to the next. In .bb1a, add a background property below the background-color property. Set it as a gradient of type linear-gradient that uses --building-color1 as the first color and --window-color1 as the second. */

/* Step 41
You want to add the same gradient to the next two sections. Instead of doing that, create a new class selector called bb1-window, and move the height and background properties and values from .bb1a to the new class selector. */

.bb1-window {
  height: 10%;
  background: linear-gradient(var(--building-color1), var(--window-color1));
}

/* Step 42
Add the new bb1-window class to the .bb1a, .bb1b, and .bb1c elements. This will apply the gradient to them. */

/* Step 43
You don't need the height or background-color properties in .bb1a, .bb1b or .bb1c anymore, so go ahead and remove them. */

/* Step 44
Gradients can use as many colors as you want like this:

gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2,
  color3
);
Add a linear-gradient to .bb1d with orange as the first color, --building-color1 as the second, and --window-color1 as the third. Remember to use the gradient on the background property. */

/* Step 45
It's a little hidden behind the foreground buildings, but you can see the three color gradient there. Since you are using that now, remove the background-color property from .bb1d. */

/* Step 46
You can specify where you want a gradient transition to complete by adding it to the color like this:

gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2 20%,
  color3
);
Here, it will transition from color1 to color2 between 0% and 20% of the element and then transition to color3 for the rest. Add 80% to the --building-color1 color of the .bb1d gradient so you can see it in action. */

/* Step 47
Remove orange from the .bb1d gradient and change the 80% to 50%. This will make --building-color1 solid for the top half, and then transition to --window-color1 for the bottom half. */

/* Step 48
Nest two new div elements within .bb2, give them the classes of bb2a and bb2b, in that order. These will be two sections for this building. */

/* MEDIA QUERIES */
/* Step 114
A media query can be used to change styles based on certain conditions, and they look like this:

@media (condition) {

}  
Add an empty media query at the bottom of your stylesheet with a condition of max-width: 1000px. Styles added in here will take effect when the document size is 1000px wide or less. */

/* Step 115
Copy and paste your whole sky class along with all of its properties and values into the media query. You are going to make another color scheme for the skyline that changes it from day to night.

Note: You are going to need to scroll past the editable region to copy the class. */

/* Step 116
In the sky class of the media query, change the two #ffcf33 color values to #ccc, the #ffff66 to #445, and the #bbeeff to #223. Then you can resize your window to see the background change colors. */

/* Step 118
Lastly, in the :root selector of the media query, redefine all four of the --window-color variables to use #777. When you're done, resize the window and watch it go from day to night.

Variables are primarily used with colors, and that's how you used them here. But they can be given any value and used on any property. Your project looks great! */

@media (max-width: 1000px) {

  :root {
    --building-color1: #000;
    --building-color2: #000;
    --building-color3: #000;
    --building-color4: #000;
    --window-color1: #777;
    --window-color2: #777;
    --window-color3: #777;
